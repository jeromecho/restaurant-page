# restaurant-page
Learning Project: Applying npm, webpack, and knowledge of ES6 modules to design a functional restaurant page.

## What I learned: 
- Importing assets on webpack 
- Writing code in modules and importing and exporting as necessary 
- Dynamically loading my pages, rather than statically

## Credits: 

This is a project I made for the Odin project. If you want to learn fullstack development, I highly recommend them. I asked many questions to other developers to understand webpack and some of the JavaScript i wrote. 


I'll be back with more : )
